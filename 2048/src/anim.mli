val ease_in_out : ?a:float -> float -> float
(** [ease_in_out ~a t] is the value of an ease in and out curve at
    time [t]. Maps unit intervals to unit intervals. [a] can be used
    to control the stiffness of the curve. *)

val tri : float -> float
(** [tri t] is a triangle (tent) curve at time [t]. Maps the unit interval
    to a triangle whose maximum is at [0.5]. The height of the triangle
    is [1.], the base at [0.]. *)
